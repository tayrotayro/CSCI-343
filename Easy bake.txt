file = open("data.txt", "r")
data=file.read()
data=data.split("\n")


This opens the text file and stores its contents

for x in range(0, len(data)):
data[x]=data[x].split(",")
#think about your data types
Science is an approximation of reality
Data 

if the data in your file was seperated by commas(a csv file), you can 
break each line into a list of each value using this method

int(string here)
float(place string here)
str(place number here)

These three functions convert strings to numbers or numbers to strings


for index in range(0, len(myList)):
#place code here
myList[index] = some_new_value
